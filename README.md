## 🎯 Game Rules

### Setup Phase
1. Players join a room using a 6-character code
2. The room creator becomes the Dealer
3. Dealer selects difficulty and whether to enable Truco!
4. A card pyramid is built (5-4-3-2-(1+players) cards)

### Question Phase
Each player answers questions about the next card to be drawn:

**Easy Mode:**
1. Is the next card Odd or Even?
2. Is the next card Higher or Lower than your last card?
3. Is the next card Inside or Outside your first two cards' range?

**Normal Mode:** (includes Easy questions +)
4. What is the suit of the next card?
5. Do you already have a card of this suit?

**Hard Mode:** (includes all questions +)
6. What is the number/face of the next card?
7. Do you already have a card of this number?

- **Correct Answer**: All other players take 1 drink
- **Wrong Answer**: You take 1 drink

### Truco! Rule (Optional)
Before a card is revealed, other players can call "Truco!" to bet against the current player:
- If the player was **correct**: Truco callers take 1 additional drink each
- If the player was **wrong**: The player takes 1 additional drink per Truco caller

### Revelation Phase
The Dealer reveals pyramid cards one by one:
- **Row 1**: Matching cards = Take 1 drink each
- **Row 2**: Matching cards = Give 2 drinks each
- **Row 3**: Matching cards = Take 3 drinks each
- **Row 4**: Matching cards = Give 4 drinks each
- **Row 5**: Matching cards = Take 5 drinks each

If no one has a matching card, everyone takes 1 drink!
